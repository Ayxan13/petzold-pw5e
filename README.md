Revisited C source code for Charles Petzold's Programming Windows 5th Edition ISBN-10 157231995X

The 5th edition Programming Windows was published in 1998 in the era of Windows 98, Windows NT and Internet Explorer 4. There is a 6th edition, but this deals with later Windows technologies - the 5th edition was the last to deal with purely C programming. Many programmers learnt (and are still learning) Windows Programming from this huge tome and its various editions. An excellent work.
